1. In the first stanza, "Cradle of night, the moon doth gleam," might be more elegant as "Cradle of the night, the moon doth gleam," to emphasize the moon as a central figure within the night.
2. "A silver orb adrift in dreams" is picturesque; however, "adrift" could be replaced with "drifting" for a smoother flow.
3. In the second stanza, "Its pale embrace, a tranquil sigh," could be revised to "Its pale embrace, a tranquil breath," to offer a more concrete image.
4. "On the seas below, it casts a eye," might be improved to "On the seas below, it casts a single eye," to enhance the imagery of the moon's watchful presence.
5. "In twilight's hush, a watchman stands," is effective, but "In twilight's silence, a watchman stands," could add a touch of elegance.
6. In the third stanza, "Its phases tell of time's slow dance," is nice, but "Its phases trace time's slow dance," may offer a stronger verb.
7. The phrase "A silent ballad, replete with chance," could be refined to "A silent ballad, woven with fate," to introduce a more retro and poetic concept.
8. Finally, the last line, "The moon, a steadfast, glowing light," could be made more elegant by revising to "The moon, a steadfast luminary, a glowing light."

- For "Branches bow low," consider "Boughs bend lowly," which has a more archaic tone.
